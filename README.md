# SER322---MyTunes
Repo for SER322 Project

You will have to add in your username, password, and database name in the db_controller file.

Place both the index.html and the db_controller.php into the same folder and deploy on a local server.

You will also need to have a mysql database set up.  The MyTunesX.X_SQL.txt file contains the sql code to generate the database.  At the moment there is no data provided for the tables, just the table set up.
