# SER322---MyTunes
Repo for SER322 Project

You will have to add in your username, password, and database name in the db_controller file.

Place both the index.html and the db_controller.php into the same folder and deploy on a local server.

You will also need to have a mysql database set up.  The MyTunesX.X_SQL.sql file contains a dump of the MyTunes database with some seed info in it already.  It should set up a working database to interact with the web server application.

You can also use the AWS named files to access the same database deployed on Amazon Web Services.

*** The AWS database no longer is up and running. ***

Final version of the project with a pretty GUI is not in this repository.  The testing interface is what is available here.
